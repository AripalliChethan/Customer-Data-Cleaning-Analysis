# Customer-Transaction-Analysis (Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis Using Python)

## Project Objective
To clean, process, and analyze customer transaction data using Python (Pandas & NumPy), ensuring data quality and generating insights on spending patterns, customer responses, and revenue distribution.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/regivm/retailtransactiondata">DataSet</a>
-Transaction dataset containing customer purchases, spending, and product details.
-Response dataset with customer feedback/engagement.
-Datasets were merged and cleaned for analysis.

## Process
-Imported and explored datasets using Pandas.
-Cleaned missing values, handled duplicates, and converted data types.
-Merged transaction and response datasets for integrated analysis.
-Created new calculated fields (e.g., total spend per customer).
-Used groupby and pivot-style analysis to evaluate spending by customer segments and responses.
-Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.

## Analysis & Insights
-Customers with positive responses had higher average spending compared to non-responders.
-Spending trends varied significantly across customer groups, suggesting targeted marketing potential.
-Data cleaning revealed inconsistencies in formats (e.g., dates, categorical labels) that were standardized.
-The integrated dataset enabled a holistic view of customer behavior.

Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills using Python, focusing on cleaning, merging, and analyzing real-world datasets.
It highlights proficiency in Pandas, NumPy, and EDA techniques, while providing meaningful insights into customer spending patterns and response behavior.
The notebook can be extended further with visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn) or advanced analysis such as customer segmentation.
